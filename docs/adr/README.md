# Architecture Decision Record

Documents in this folder follow the concept from [this blog - Why Write ADRs?](https://github.blog/2020-08-13-why-write-adrs/).

Please refer to https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record for examples.


## ADR file name conventions

- The name starts with three-digit number to specify the ID of the ADR. e.g., `001_choose_database.md`.
- The name has a present tense imperative verb phrase. This helps readability and matches our commit message format.
- The name uses lowercase and underscores (same as this repo). This is a balance of readability and system usability.
- The extension is markdown. This can be useful for easy formatting.

Example

- 001_choose_database.md
- 002_format_timestamps.md
- 003_manage_passwords.md
- 004_handle_exceptions.md
